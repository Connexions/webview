  <h2>THINGS TO KEEP IN MIND WHEN YOU START</h2>
  <p>Okay, now that you’ve successfully gotten rid of all these Internet distractions, it’s time to start! </p>
  <p>Firstly, it’s important to have an end goal in mind. Do you have an upcoming test or paper? Homework assignment? Here are some helpful ideas to optimize your time depending on what you are hoping to get out of your reading:</p>
  <p><b>Paper:</b> If you are writing a paper, keep your thesis in mind. You are reading for information and examples that can be used to support your paper’s thesis. If you don’t have a thesis yet, read with intent to find a topic or thesis that can be supported by the text.</p>
  <p><b>Test:</b> With an upcoming test or quiz, the first thing you want to do is make sure you understand the broadest, most general topics. From there, start paying attention to the smaller details and examples that the text offers. Test your knowledge by trying to work out some examples on your own first.</p>
  <p><b>Homework:</b> Similar to a test, you want to make sure that you understand the general idea first. Use your homework questions as a reading guide—this will focus your attention to the most important details. This is also the best opportunity to note any conceptual or clarification questions that you may have.</p>

  <h2>TIME TO START NOTE TAKING</h2>
  <p>Okay, it’s finally time to start taking notes. Here’s a list of steps that can help you get started taking notes and retain all that you have read:</p>
  <ol><li>Read at least one complete paragraph or mini section before starting to highlight and take notes. This will help you focus on taking notes on what is important.</li>
  <li>Highlight key phrases that you’ll need for the future (not just words, not long sentences)--exceptions might be dates and definitions.</li>
  <li>Write questions for yourself based on the reading that you can use to test yourself later.</li>
  <li>Write down clarification questions that you want to ask someone later/observations or connections that you have on the text.</li>
  <li>At the end of a large section, summarize what you have read without using direct phrases/sentences from the textbook.</li></ol>

  <h3>Other tips:</h3>
  <li>Use your own words! By re-wording and paraphrasing the text, you are already synthesizing and making sense of what you are reading.</li>
  <li>Use consistent abbreviations and shorthand.</li>
  <li>If something is repeated (formulas, concepts, ideas, facts, processes, etc.), it’s most likely important! Be sure to record these and emphasize these in your notes.</li>
